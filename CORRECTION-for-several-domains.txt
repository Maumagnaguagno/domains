 * I did not design any of the domains (5), (6), (8), (9) (and do not
   really understand how these happened to be attributed to myself
   during the benchmark collection process). I DID write scripts which
   add hierarchical information (i.e. the initial tasks) to classical
   planning PDDL problem files for (5) and (6) (these scripts work more
   or less syntactically except for making sure that the ordering of
   initial tasks actually works for the problem).
 * I wrote Arnaud Lequen (former intern working with Damien & Humbert)
   and he agreed to write papers for (8) and (9) (or maybe one paper
   for both).
 * Regarding copyright, it's Malte Sönnichsen and myself for (7). For
   (8) and (9) it's Arnaud Lequen, possibly together with Damien /
   Humbert / Djalil / ??? (because Arnaud /improved/ the HTN domains
   but did not create them from scratch – there's older (and worse)
   versions of these domains). For the others I guess it's varying
   people from the Grenoble group.
